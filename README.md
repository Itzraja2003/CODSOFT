Welcome to my Data Science Internship Portfolio! In this repository, you will find a collection of projects that I have completed during my internship at Codsoft. Each project showcases my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving. Below is a summary of the projects:

PROJECT
Titanic Survival Detection Description: This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building a machine learning model to predict survival probabilities.

Iris Flower Classification Description: The Iris Flower Classification project is a classic machine learning task. It involves using the Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

Credit Card Fraud Detection Description: In the Credit Card Fraud Detection project, I developed a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The project addresses class imbalance, preprocesses data, and uses logistic regression for classification.
